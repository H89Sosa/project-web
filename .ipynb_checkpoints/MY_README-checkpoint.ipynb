    "## by Hernán Sosa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our objective for this project will be **creating a function that gives us information about all the shows** an artist (or artist) has done. \n",
    "This function should give us:\n",
    "- Data for an artist or a list or artists.\n",
    "- Data for a genre or a list of genres.\n",
    "- We'll have to be able to specify how many artist to get\n",
    "\n",
    "This data has to be clean, readable and organized. We'll have to use both web and API scraping to gather the data.\n",
    "By examining both tools, we figured out that our way to do it will be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 0. Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we know that we'll need the following data:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - Artists database\n",
    "     - Genres database\n",
    "     - Popularity Database\n",
    "     - Shows database\n",
    "     - Info for each show\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **`Discogs`** is an internet web database which compiles over 170,000 artists, classified by genres. Also classifies every artist by sub-genre and popularity. Includes metadata for each album released for each artist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this information, we'll know that we will use `web scraping` to gather the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Artist Database\n",
    "    - Genres Database\n",
    "    - Get popularity for each artist\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### **`Songkick`** is an API that contains information about every show an artist has done in his carreer. We found out that, in order to access an artist, we need a Songkick ID. For that matter we'll have to split our API job into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Getting ID for an artist\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Fetching Data for that ID\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    " \n",
    "#### For the job, we'll be importing the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "        `import requests\n",
    "        import json\n",
    "        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n",

    "We want to get a list with `n` artists, searching by most popular albums by style in discogs.com. By changing the style in the link, we can apply the same job on other music styles. The style code in the link its noted as '`&style_exact=Sample+Style`'. By concatenating them, we can choose multiple styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We extracted the artist name for each record stored in the page. The tag for the artist is named 'h5'.\n",

    "Now we find a problem. The sited is mainly organized by GENRES or STYLES (sub-genres). In order to properly use one of them, we'll need to extract the page link instead of the genre/style name, because each type has its own path:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can extract the 'style_exact=Sample+Style' items:\n",

    "We'll define a function that searches for a Genre or Style, and returns it's link piece, with the format ' &'GENRE/STYLE'_exact=ENTRY' For that matter, we'll filter if the keyword belongs to Genre or Style, then we'll apply the link piece format.\n",
